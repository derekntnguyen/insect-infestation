# Insect Infestation

This python script contains a simulation of a wood-boring insect infestation within a forest.

This simulation utilizes cellular automata based on percolation theory. The forest is initially randomly seeded with trees at a parameter, density, and then undergoes an infestation utilizing ndimage.generic_filter function.
